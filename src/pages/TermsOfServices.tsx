        Welcome to GeniusTV! These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your use of the GeniusTV
        streaming service. By accessing or using our services, you agree to be bound by these
        Terms.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-foreground">1. Description of Service</h2>
      <p className=" font-semibold mb-6 leading-relaxed">
        GeniusTV provides a premium, subscription-based IPTV streaming service that delivers a
        vast selection of live television channels and a comprehensive on-demand library of movies
        and series (VOD). Our content is updated weekly to ensure you have access to a fresh and
        dynamic entertainment experience. The service is available worldwide.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-foreground">2. Account and Access</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6 space-y-3 ml-4">
        <li>
          <span className="font-semibold">Service Access:</span> We provide you with access to our service via a unique M3U link or
          Xtream Codes. You are free to use these credentials with any compatible IPTV player
          application. We also offer our own dedicated application for Android devices.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="font-semibold">Customer Support:</span> Our team is available to assist you with the entire activation

        <li>
          <span className="font-semibold">Simultaneous Connections:</span> Each subscription plan corresponds to a specific
          number of simultaneous connections. A single account can only be used on one

          multiple simultaneous connections (e.g., 2 or 3 devices).

          performance.

          our service.
